# Loan Prediction - Deployment using streamlit and heroku 
Problem - Based on the details provided by customers, we have to create a model that can decide where or not their loan should be approved. 
Data Set - And the data related to the customers and loan is provided at the datahack platform of Analytics Vidhya.
 Model building - Since it is a classification problem, we can use any of the classification models like the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, etc. I have tried all of these 3 models for this problem and random forest produced the best results. So, I have used  random forest as the predictive model for this project.
I ahve deployed the model using streamlit and heroku
